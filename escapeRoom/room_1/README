Hey There young traveler!
This is the secret Linux Escape Room cave!
This place is full of secrets and only the chosen can pass the cave!
The folder /home/escape/escapeRoom contain 10 folders(rooms), each folder has an encrypted READMY file (except the first room README )
To figure out how to get away you need to find the pass to the next room README file by following the clues and learning Linux!
Lets start:
This is what you need to do in the First room:
1. Go to 'room_files' folder and delete/move/filter-out all the files with 'txt' extention...we dont need them here. highly recommended to backup the folder before you do soemthing...
2. Sort recursively the remainig files in 'room_files' by size (Ascending Order, and  dont forget the hidden files!! ) and display the file names on the screen, then if you take the first letter of each filename top-to-bottom ,you should find a hidden message consisted of two words.
3. Once you discover the hidden message, move to the next room.
4. To open the README file apply the hidden message in lowercase without spaces...

Every README file uses 'vim encryption'...to open them you will need a password...

And one last tip...to make the magic happen (delete, rename, change ownership, create files and etc.)
 you will need your secret sudo password: "escape".
