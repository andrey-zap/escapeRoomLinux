Hey There young traveler!
This is the secret Linux Escape Room cave!
This place is full of secrets and only the chosen can pass the cave!	
To figure out how to get away you need to find the pass to the next room READMY file by following the clues and learning Linux:
Lets start:
This is what you need to do in the First room:
1. Go to 'room_files' folder and delete/move all the files with 'txt' extention...highly recommended to backup the folder before you do soemthing...
2. list the names of the remaining files in a sorted by size order and take the first letter of each filename and try to find the hidden message.
3. the pass to next stage README is the hidden message in lowercase...

The README files in the next stages are using 'vim encryption'...to open them you will need a password...

and one last thing...to make the magic(delete,rename,change ownership,create files and etc)
 you will need your secret sudo password: "escape".
