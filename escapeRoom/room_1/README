Hey There young traveler!
This is the secret Linux Escape Room cave!
This place is full of secrets and only the chosen can pass the cave!	
To figure out how to get away you need to find the pass to the next room READMY file by following the clues and learning Linux:
Lets start:
This is what you need to do in the First room:
1. Go to 'room_files' folder and delete/move all the files with 'txt' extention...highly recommended to backup the folder before you do soemthing...
2. Sort the remainig files by size, then look at the first letter of each filename(dont forget the hidden files),you will find a hidden message.
3. Once you discover the hidden message, move to the next room.
4. To open the README file apply the hidden message in lowercase...

Every README file uses 'vim encryption'...to open them you will need a password...

And one last tip...to make the magic happen (delete,rename,change ownership,create files and etc)
 you will need your secret sudo password: "escape".
