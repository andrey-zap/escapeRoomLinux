Hey,
The room keeper of this room is a crazy guy who speaks very odd.
To be able to read the message you will need to do the following:
1. The room keeper doesnt like the letter 'H' so he replaced it with 'zing' (dont ask me why...)
2. He also not much into 'h' so he replace it with 'blu'.
3 Last thing is that the keeper very hates 'i' and he prefer to say it as 'bla'
P.S
The keeper love to use 'sed' command....
