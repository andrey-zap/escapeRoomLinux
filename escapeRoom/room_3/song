Every creature needs a home
Somewhere to hideand creep

Every creature needs a home
Where babies can safely sleep

Where does a penguin make its nest?
Where do pelicans spend the night?
Where do I watch for wombats?

And where does a frog go to stay out of sight?
Where is home for the honey bee?
Where do platypuses like to play?

Where do the bats fly at sunrise?
And where does the possum go to sleep all day?
Where do the ravens go to roost?
Where do cormorants congregate?
Who sleeps in that hollow log?

Where does flamingo go when it's late?
