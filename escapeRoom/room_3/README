Hi,
This room has a strange but very kindly creature: Scriptacorus!! 
This is a script creature, every script creature has a tail '.sh'
You should read about them before touching one of those things!
The creature is locked with a key, this is how to release it:

To release the creature you need to get the key to open the encrypted cage:
1. The key is the number of all the words in the song file! you can count them one by one...or...read about WC
2. use vim to open the creature.sh
3. enter the key
4.disable encryption with ':set key=' command (setting the encrypt key to empty)
5. save the new file unencrypted
