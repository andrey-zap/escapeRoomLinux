The Bash Escape Room is a docker based exercise. In order to start the game:
1. Make sure you have Docker installed: $ docker -v
   If you don't, then look it up online with your favorite search engine.
2. Build the Escape Room from within this directory: $ docker build -t escape-room .
   (notice the `.` at the end of the command)
3. Start the game: docker run -it escape-room
See you at the end!
