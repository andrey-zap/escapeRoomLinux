Intro:
This is an series of rooms (similar to the real-life attractions of Escape rooms) with puzzles that
are designed to train the player at using various commands and features of Bash and Linux.

Setup:
The Bash Escape Room is a docker based exercise. In order to start the game:
1. Make sure you have Docker installed: $ docker -v
   If you don't, then look it up online with your favorite search engine.
2. Build the Escape Room from within this directory: 
   $ docker build -t escape-room .
   (notice the `.` at the end of the command)
3. Start the game: 
   $ docker run -it escape-room
4. Start by viewing the First rooms README located in
   ~/escapeRoom/room_1/README
See you at the end!

FAQ/Troubleshooting:
1. Q: During build I get a `/bin/sh: 1: ./initEscapeRoom.sh: Permission denied` error, what to do?
   A: Make sure you have set the script's permissions to executable: $ chmod 755 initEscapeRoom.sh
2. Q: Can I use sudo commands?
   A: Yes, your user (escape) is a sudo-er, with password: escape
3. Q: Help I am stuck!
   A: Tough. Use a search engine or ask you friends...
      There is a solutions.txt file in here too, but it is password protected with the last room's
      treasure chest password.
